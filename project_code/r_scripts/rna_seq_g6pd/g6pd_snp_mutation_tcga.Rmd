This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}
mutated_samples_path <- download_url("https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wLxQFgHJ1aW-r-jTnXV7btngA1Bcpm3C")
```

```{r}
#mutated_samples_path <- "C:/Users/vikashk/Desktop/g6pd_cbioportal_mutated/mutated_samples.tsv"
library(readr)
#mutated_samples <- read_tsv(mutated_samples_path)
mutated_samples <- read_tsv(mutated_samples_path)
mutated_samples
```
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

significant_impacted_samples <- mutated_samples %>%
  filter(str_detect(`Functional Impact`, regex("MutationAssessor: high|impact: deleterious|impact: probably_damaging|pathogenicity: pathogenic", ignore_case = TRUE)))
significant_impacted_samples
high_allele_frequency <- significant_impacted_samples #%>% filter(`Allele Freq (T)` > 0.1)
high_allele_frequency
```
```{r}
length(unique(high_allele_frequency$`Sample ID`))
sig_mut_plus_del <- download_url("https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eRDm68CTg2e4tUvJrJWWoYaJCPnNJm_v")
sig_mut_plus_del <- read.csv(sig_mut_plus_del, header = TRUE)
sig_mut_plus_del

```
```{r}
length(intersect(high_allele_frequency$`Sample ID`, sig_mut_plus_del$Sample.ID))

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
